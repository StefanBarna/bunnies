# bunnies
The bunny project displays a 50x50 grid to the user, simulating the activities of a colony of bunnies. At run time, 5 bunnies will be spawned. After becoming 2 years of age, a bunny can reproduce, given at least one male and any number of females. The amount of babies spawned will be based on the amount of females above the age of 2. As the colony gets bigger, more and more bunnies will be displayed on the screen at random locations. However, the possibility of an infective virus outbreak. Every time a baby bunny spawns, there's a chance it mutates and develops this virus. Infected bunnies live for 50 years, while normal bunnies live for only 10. Each turn, for every infected bunny on the grid, a new bunny will be infected. Another problem these bunnies face is overcrowding. if more than 1000 bunnies are on the board at any given time, there will be a famine, and half the bunnies will die. The user can simulate this famine by pressing [k], which also kills half the population of bunnies.
