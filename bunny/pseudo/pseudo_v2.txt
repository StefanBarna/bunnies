// private members
a list representing the colony

// creating the original bunnies
for 5 times
	create a bunny with a random colour

while there are bunnies alive
	// ageing
	for each bunny b in the colony
		increment age by one
		if the age exceeds 10
			kill b (remove from colony)
	
	// breeding
	boolean isMale = whether there is a mature non-radioactive male bunny
	if isMale is true
		run through the colony members
		if a bunny is female
			add a new bunny of the same colour (age 0) to the colony
	
	// radioactive spread
	run through colony members
	if there is a non-radioactive bunny
		size_t cntRadio = number of infected bunnies
		for every infected bunny
			int idx = get a random number
			while the bunny at idx is infected
				get another random idx
			convert bunny at idx to infected
	otherwise
		don't infect any bunnies
	
	// culling
	if the colony's count is over 1000
		integer cnt = half the size of the colony
		for cnt times
			remove a bunny at a random location (from 0 to the colony size)
	
	// sorting
	while there are more than two elements in a split section of the colony
		split the colony in half
	sort (to switch or not to switch)
	recreate the list representing the colony with the first list
	while there are lists remaining
		sort list 1 and 2
	
	// displaying
	for every bunny in the colony
		print the bunny
