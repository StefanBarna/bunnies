// creating the original bunnies
make 5 bunnies with random colours

while there are bunnies alive
	// ageing
	for each bunny b in the colony
		increase age of b
		if age of b > 10
			remove b from the colony

	// breeding
	cntmales = whether or not there is a mature non-radioactive male bunny
	if cntmales is more than 1
		for each mature non-radioactive female in the colony
			make a baby with the same colour, add it to the collection

	// radioactivity
	check if there are any noninfected bunnies (cycle through the colony)
	if there are uninfected bunnies
		cntradioactive = number of radioactive bunnies
		for cntradioactive bunny in colony
			idx = get a random number from 0 to colony size
			while idx is infected
				get a new idx	
			convert idx to infected
	otherwise don't infect anyone

	// culling
	if there are more than 1000 bunnies
		kill half the bunnies

	// printing the bunnies
	sort the bunnies by age // implement bubble sort and merge sort and compare the times
	for each bunny b in the colony
		print b
